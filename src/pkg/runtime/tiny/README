This directory contains a simple example of how one might
start Go running on bare hardware. There is currently code
for 386 only.

386
---

It is very primitive but can run go/test/sieve.go, the concurrent
prime sieve, on a uniprocessor.

To run, first build the tools by running all.bash with GOARCH=386
and GOOS set to your normal GOOS (linux, darwin).  Then:

	export GOOS=tiny
	cd $GOROOT/src/pkg
	make clean install
	cd $GOROOT/src/pkg/runtime/tiny
	8g $GOROOT/test/sieve.go
	8l sieve.8
	8l -a sieve.8 >sieve.asm	# can consult sieve.asm for debugging
	dd if=/dev/zero of=disk count=10000
	cat bootblock 8.out | dd of=disk conv=notrunc

Use the built-in print(text string) function to print to the
console.


BOCHS
-----

You may have to tweak the .bochsrc depending on your system,
and you may need to install the Bochs emulator.

    $ cp dot-bochsrc .bochsrc
    $ $EDITOR .bochsrc # tweak it if required
    $ bochs

ORACLE xVM VIRTUALBOX
---------------------

Install VirtualBox. Then:

    Build 'disk' (described above under '386').

    $ VBoxManage convertfromraw disk go-tiny.vdi
    $ VirtualBox
        create a new VM; as disk use the go-tiny.vdi image.
        start the vm.


QEMU / KVM
----------

This should work the same for qemu and kvm (really: qemu-kvm).

    Build 'disk' (described above under '386').

    $ qemu -hda disk


ARM
---

Arm support does not exist anymore. It was removed from
Go in this commit, which might help the enterprising hacker
get it working again.
